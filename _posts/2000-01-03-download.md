## Getting Jsondb

Stable Jsondb builds are uploaded to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.jsondb%22%20AND%20a%3A%22jsondb-core%22)

- You can download the **jar**, **source-jar** or **javadoc-jar** from Maven Central and use it in the traditional way by adding it into your classpath. Jsondb uses quite a few of other opensource java libraries so doing it this way will involve getting all those libraries and adding to your classpath.
- Optionally (Recommended) if you use Maven, Gradle or any such build system you can get it as a dependency using the appropriate dependency code.

**Example:**
{% highlight html %}
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.jsondb/jsondb-core -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.jsondb</groupId>
  <artifactId>jsondb-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.106</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}
