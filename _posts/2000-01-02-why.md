## Why Jsondb


You have a Java based program (or even Android App) and you:

- Need a light weight database of some kind to store a small amount (a few 1000 rows) of data,
- Need a pure Java easy to use database, multi-thread safe,
- Need some ORM support,
- Need a good query interface,
- Need atomicity for database operations,
- Want to be able to easily add, edit, update, delete the db data files, even when Jsondb is running,
- Want to be able to move the db files seamlessly download over runtime and update all dynamically,
- Want to be able to safegaurd sensitive data (passwords etc) in the db data files, with some high strength encryption,
