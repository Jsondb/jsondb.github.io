## Why Jsondb

You have a Java based program (or even Android App) and you:

- Need a light weight database of some kind to store a small amount (a few 1000 rows) of data,
- Need a pure java, easy to use, thread safe database,
- Need some ORM support,
- Need a good query interface,
- Okay with Mongodb like per API level atomicity (okay with eventualy data consistency),
- Want to be able to easily add, edit, update, delete the db data files, even when Jsondb is running,
- Want to be able to move the db files seamlessly, download updated files over network while db is running,
- Want to be able to safegaurd sensitive data (passwords etc) in the db data files, with some high strength encryption,

## Why NOT Jsondb

- Jsondb loads the db data files into memory, all API's return deeply cloned objects so you will need minimum as much memory as the size of data files and some more,
- Jsondb does not have full transaction support (does support Mongodb like atomic API's)
